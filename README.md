# Oscars-Project

When I realized that BuzzFeed publishes the datasets of some of their stories, I had to give it a try. I found [an article](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/lamvo/oscars-script-diversity-analysis) and [correspinding analyses](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-03-oscars-script-diversity-analysis) that interested me- not only did they publish their data, but they also published their Python code. As someone who is learning Python, I thought it could be a good learning experience to try and recreate their Python code in SQL (something else that I am learning!).
<br><br>
I ended up spending 60% of my time trying to group data by rows AND columns- I cannot tell you how many cte's and subqueries I wrote, but that pivot function was simply not happening for me. So, for that one step of the analyses I gave up and just spent 15 minutes doing it in excel.
<br> <br>
In this repository, you will find the SQL queries that I wrote, with a brief summary of the work I additionally created in excel. You will also find my excel file, with all of the values which were produced in the original BuzzFeed analysis.
<br><br>
In the "second file" you can even see me use some more advanced SQL functions such as CTE's and creating tables, and getting to use more complex group by type statements properly (unlike in the first file, where it would not work).
